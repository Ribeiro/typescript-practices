 Classes will not be included here
 Try to use functional approaches always!
 Your code should not have `class` definitions, believe you don't need them

 DOM types will be omitted, targeting here mostly Node.js


 Any

 "Temporary excuse"
 disabled by compiler flag

```ts

const anyValue: any = {};
```

 Unknown
 Better not to use it explicitly
 Used in `catch` recently

```ts
const maybe: unknown = {};
```
 sample usage 
```ts
const maybeSomething = {} as unknown;
```

 Void,
 aka `nothing`

```ts
function none(): void {}

```
