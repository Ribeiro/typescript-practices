 Classes will not be included here
 Try to use functional approaches always!
 Your code should not have `class` definitions, believe you don't need them

 DOM types will be omitted, targeting here mostly Node.js


 Any

 "Temporary excuse"
 disabled by compiler flag

```ts

const anyValue: any = {};
```

 Unknown
 Better not to use it explicitly
 Used in `catch` recently

```ts
const maybe: unknown = {};
```
 sample usage 
```ts
const maybeSomething = {} as unknown;
```

 Void,
 aka `nothing`

```ts
function none(): void {}
function log(line: string): void {
  console.log(line);
}
```

 Basic

```ts
const str: string = "1"; // '111', `111 ${variable}`
const yes: boolean = true;
const obj: Object = {};
```
 Please do not use `Function` it is like `any` amongst functions
```ts
const func: Function = () => 1;
```

 Symbol

 Always unique, in practice `enum` is more adopted

```ts
let sym1 = Symbol("something");
let symbolYes1 = Symbol("yes");
let symbolYes2 = Symbol("yes");
```
 symbolYes1 === symbolYes2 // false

 Numeric

```ts
let num: number = 6;
let readableNumber: number = 5_000_000_000;
let hex: number = 0xf00d;
let binary: number = 0b1010;
let octal: number = 0o744;
```
 from ES2020
```ts
let big: bigint = 10000000000000000000000000000n;
```

 Arrays

```ts
const array: any[] = ["a", "b"];
const anotherArray: Array<number> = [1, 2];
const arrayComplex: string[][] = [
  ["a", "b"],
  ["c", "d"],
];
const mixedArray: (number | string | boolean)[] = [1, "2", true];
const strangeArray: (number | number[])[] = [1, [1]];
```

 Tuple

```ts
const sampleTuple: [string, number, boolean] = ["a", 1, true];
```

 Enum

 Without values
```ts
enum Status {
  OK,
  FAILURE,
}
const myStatus: Status = Status.OK;

```
 With explicit values
```ts
enum Counter {
  ONE = "a",
  TWO = "b",
  THREE = "c",
}
const myNumber: Counter = Counter.TWO;

```

 Undefined, null

 Undefined is usually used for implicit `nothing there`
 Pure undefined:
```ts
let undef: undefined;
const data1: undefined = [].find((x) => x > 0);
```
 To represent `maybe` ?
```ts
const data2: undefined | number = [1].find((x) => x > 0);
```
 Usually used for explicit `not set` but better to use undefined
```ts
let _null: null = null;

```

 never

```ts

function explode(): never {
  throw new Error("bam");
}

```

 Object
 Everything else except number, string, boolean, symbol, null, or undefined

 Generally, you wonâ€™t need to use this
 `Object` is `any` amongst objects
```ts
const data3: Object = {};

```
